              <h2>Welcome to the Livestock Information Service</h2>
              <p>This is the first step in a series of changes to livestock reporting in England, replacing the current ARAMS service and in the future, providing a single place for all livestock reporting. â€¯</p>
              <h2>Livestock reporting</h2>
              <p>The new Livestock Information Service can currently be used for reporting sheep, goat and deer movements. There is also an option to maintain an online Holding Register by recording other livestock events such as tagging.</p>
              <h2>Create account or Sign in</h2>
              <p>To create an account, you will need a CPH and be registered as a keeper.</p>
              <LsLink onClick={goToSignup} className="m--b-xlarge" type="button">Create account / Sign in</LsLink>
              <p>Using the online service to report your livestock movements makes a real difference for traceability - digital notifications are faster and more accurate.</p>
